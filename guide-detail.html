                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Getting a new tattoo is exciting, but the healing period is just as important as the time you
                        spend in the artist's chair. Proper aftercare determines whether your tattoo will stay crisp and
                        vibrant or heal unevenly and lose detail.</p>

                    <h2>Follow Your Artist's Instructions</h2>
                    <p>The best thing you can do is follow your artist's specific instructions, because every artist has
                        preferences based on their technique, equipment, and experience. No matter the design, you
                        should always keep your fresh tattoo clean by gently washing it twice a day with lukewarm water
                        and a mild, fragrance-free soap.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Wash with lukewarm water and fragrance-free soap</li>
                        <li>Pat dry with a clean paper towel, avoiding rubbing</li>
                        <li>Apply a thin layer of unscented moisturizer or tattoo aftercare balm</li>
                        <li>Don't over-apply moisture - it can suffocate the area</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>What to Avoid During Healing</h2>
                    <p>During the healing phase, wearing loose clothing makes a big difference, especially if your
                        tattoo is in a spot where fabric rubs against the skin. Tight clothes can stick to a healing
                        tattoo or cause friction that disrupts the healing process.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Don't pick or scratch at the tattoo, even when it itches or flakes</li>
                        <li>Avoid soaking in water - no baths, pools, hot tubs, or beach trips</li>
                        <li>Stay away from sun exposure - UV rays fade tattoos quickly</li>
                        <li>Don't wear tight clothing that creates friction</li>
                        <li>Once healed, sunscreen becomes your tattoo's best friend</li>
                    </ul>

                <section class="guide-section">
                    <h2>The Healing Timeline</h2>
                    <p>It's completely normal for your tattoo to look a bit dull or cloudy during the first couple of
                        weeks. The healing process involves a thin layer of skin forming over the tattoo, temporarily
                        muting the colors or shading. The final appearance usually comes through after the tattoo has
                        fully healed, which generally takes two to four weeks depending on size, placement, and your
                        skin type.</p>
                    <p>By giving your tattoo the care it needs early on, you're setting it up to stay bold, sharp, and
                        beautiful for years to come.</p>
