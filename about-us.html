        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to make finding and connecting with the right tattoo artist simple, trustworthy, and
            stress-free.
        <p>InkSeek was created to take the fear and confusion out of finding the right tattoo artist by bringing
            clients and artists together in a space built on trust, transparency, and genuine connection.</p>

        <p>We know tattoos are deeply personal, so we're building a community where people can explore styles, discover
            artists, and make confident decisions without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

        For artists, InkSeek offers a dedicated home to showcase their craft without getting lost in the noise of
        social media.

        At our core, we're here to make the tattoo experience easier, safer, and more meaningful for everyone
        involved.</p>
